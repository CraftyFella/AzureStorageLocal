# FakeAzureTables

[![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FakeAzureTables.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FakeAzureTables/)

An in memory fake for Azure Table Storage for integration testing or end to end testing. I'm still working on this and only a subset of functionailty is covered. Expect breaking changes and issues until it's at v1.
